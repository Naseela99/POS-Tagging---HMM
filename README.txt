For the code to run smoothly the following things must be ensured:

1. Cd to the directory where the py file is or open the terminal in the directory where the file is.

2. The input files are placed inside the data directory inside the directory where the py file is.

3. The output files will be generated in the same folder as the py file

To run the py file, type the command in the terminal:
	python hw2.py


The command generates the vocab.txt, hmm.json, greedy.out and viterbi.out. In addition to the given outputs, I have also included the print statements to match the answers in the pdf file. 


The py file uses the following python packages:

1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Json
